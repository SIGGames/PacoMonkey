# PacoMonkey

## Introduction

PacoMonkey is a single-player pixel art game developed in [Unity](https://unity.com/products/unity-engine) that combines
simplicity with captivating gameplay, appealing to a wide range of players.

This funny adventure, survival and platform game follows the life-story of the mandrill primate Pacomonkey. During his vengeance journey through different biomes,
Pacomonkey defeats all the monkeys that stand in his way while he grows and learns new abilities and uncovers clues about 
the whereabouts of the killer.

This project is the result of a collaboration among passionate and creative developers inspired by [UdL](https://www.udl.cat/ca/en/) called [Special Interest Group](https://github.com/orgs/SIGGgames/teams/siggames-team).
